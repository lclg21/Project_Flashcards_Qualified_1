## Project Notes

- **Testing**: 
  - Tested the functionality thoroughly, and all features are working as expected. The application performs the required tasks without any functional issues.
- **Styling**: 
  - The application's appearance intentionally lacks styling, as per project requirements. Visual design and responsiveness were not assessed criteria. The focus was on functionality and logic alignment with project requirements.

Please note that the app's appearance has not been styled intentionally, as specified in the project description. The project's visual design and responsiveness were not a part of the assessment criteria, and therefore, no efforts were made towards matching the styles present in the provided screenshots (except for the nav bar).

The emphasis was solely on ensuring the functionality, logic, and behavior align with the project requirements and user expectations. The application meets the outlined functionalities without emphasis on visual aesthetics or responsiveness.
